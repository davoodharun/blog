# Abstract Compositions - Digital Art Series

This series explores the intersection of digital art and abstract expressionism, creating visual experiences that evoke emotion through color, form, and movement.

## About This Project

The "Abstract Compositions" series was created as an exploration of digital art techniques and their potential for emotional expression. Each piece was designed to work both as standalone artwork and as part of larger VJ performances.

## Technical Approach

### Software Used
- **TouchDesigner** for real-time generative art
- **After Effects** for post-processing and animation
- **Photoshop** for final color grading and refinement

### Creative Process

Each composition began with simple geometric forms that were then processed through various algorithms and effects chains. The goal was to create pieces that felt both calculated and organic, combining mathematical precision with artistic intuition.

## Design Principles

### Color Theory
The series explores various color relationships:
- **Complementary colors** for high contrast and energy
- **Analogous schemes** for harmony and flow
- **Monochromatic variations** for depth and subtlety

### Composition
Each piece follows principles of:
- **Balance** between positive and negative space
- **Rhythm** through repeating elements
- **Depth** created through layering and perspective

## Applications

These compositions have been used in:
- **VJ performances** at electronic music events
- **Digital installations** in gallery spaces
- **Background visuals** for ambient music videos
- **Print media** for album artwork and posters

## Future Directions

I'm currently exploring:
- **Interactive elements** that respond to sound or movement
- **3D rendering** techniques for more complex spatial relationships
- **Real-time generation** for live performance applications

The series continues to evolve as I discover new techniques and approaches to digital art creation.
