# The Messy Truth About Creativity: Insights from a Decade of Making Things

After ten years of creating—writing, coding, designing, and occasionally attempting to make music (with varying degrees of success)—I've learned that creativity is nothing like what we're taught. It's not a linear process, it's not always inspired, and it's definitely not always fun. But it is always worth it, even when it feels like you're banging your head against a wall.

## The Myth of the Creative Genius

We're sold this idea that creative people are somehow different—that they have access to some mystical well of inspiration that the rest of us don't. This is complete nonsense, and honestly, it's kind of annoying.

The truth is, creativity is a skill. Like any skill, it requires practice, patience, and a willingness to fail spectacularly. The "geniuses" we admire are usually just people who've learned to show up every day, even when they don't feel like it. They're not magical unicorns; they're just really good at being consistent.

## The 90% Rule

Here's something I've learned the hard way (and by "hard way," I mean through countless hours of creating things that were objectively terrible): 90% of what you create will be mediocre at best. Maybe 5% will be good, and if you're lucky, 1% will be genuinely great.

This isn't discouraging—it's liberating. Once you accept that most of your work won't be your best work, you can stop being paralyzed by perfectionism and just start creating. It's like giving yourself permission to suck, which is surprisingly freeing.

## The Creative Process is Not Linear

We like to think of creativity as a straight line: inspiration → idea → execution → masterpiece. In reality, it's more like a chaotic dance that looks like you're having a seizure while trying to solve a Rubik's cube.

Here's what it actually looks like:

1. **The Spark**: A vague feeling or half-formed idea (usually happens in the shower or at 3 AM)
2. **The Doubt**: "This is stupid, why am I even trying?" (this step can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 months)
3. **The Struggle**: Hours of work that feels like it's going nowhere (the "why did I think this was a good idea?" phase)
4. **The Breakthrough**: A moment of clarity that changes everything (usually happens when you're about to give up)
5. **The Refinement**: The hard work of making it actually good (the part where you realize it's not as good as you thought)
6. **The Release**: Letting it go, knowing it's not perfect (because nothing ever is)

Sometimes these steps happen in order. Sometimes they happen simultaneously. Sometimes you get stuck in step 2 for weeks (or months, or years).

## The Role of Constraints

Paradoxically, creativity thrives on constraints. Give me unlimited time and resources, and I'll probably create nothing (or spend all my time organizing my workspace). Give me a deadline, a limited palette, or a specific problem to solve, and suddenly ideas start flowing like someone turned on a faucet.

This is why so many great works of art come from periods of scarcity or limitation. When you can't do everything, you're forced to be more intentional about what you do. It's like being given a box of crayons instead of an entire art store—sometimes having fewer options actually makes you more creative.

## The Importance of Boredom

Some of my best ideas have come when I was bored out of my mind. There's something about the space that boredom creates—it allows your mind to wander in unexpected directions, like a dog that's been let off its leash.

I've learned to embrace boredom rather than fight it. When I'm stuck on a creative problem, I'll often go for a walk without my phone, or just sit somewhere quiet and let my mind drift. The solution usually appears when I'm not actively looking for it, like a cat that only comes when you're not trying to pet it.

## The Creative Block is a Lie

We talk about "creative block" as if it's some mysterious condition that strikes without warning, like a creative flu. But in my experience, it's usually one of three things:

1. **Fear**: You're afraid the work won't be good enough (spoiler alert: it probably won't be, and that's okay)
2. **Perfectionism**: You're waiting for the perfect idea or the perfect conditions (spoiler alert: they don't exist)
3. **Burnout**: You're exhausted and need to rest (spoiler alert: you probably need a nap)

The solution is usually simple: start with something small and terrible. Write a terrible first draft. Draw a terrible sketch. Code a terrible prototype. Once you have something—anything—on the page, you can start improving it. It's like making a sculpture: you start with a lump of clay, not a masterpiece.

## The Power of Stealing

Every creative person I know is a thief. We steal ideas, techniques, and inspiration from everywhere. The key is to steal like an artist: take what you love, transform it, and make it your own. It's not plagiarism; it's creative recycling.

I have a folder on my computer called "Inspiration" filled with screenshots, quotes, and half-formed ideas. When I'm stuck, I'll browse through it and see what sparks something new. It's like having a creative junk drawer that occasionally produces gold.

## The Creative Community

Creativity is often portrayed as a solitary pursuit, but the truth is that we're all building on each other's work. Some of my best ideas have come from conversations with other creators, from seeing their work, or from collaborating on projects. It's like being part of a giant creative potluck where everyone brings something different to the table.

Find your creative community. Share your work, even when it's not perfect (especially when it's not perfect). Give feedback to others. You'll be surprised how much you learn from the process, and how much better your work becomes when you're not creating in a vacuum.

## The Myth of Originality

Here's a secret: there are no truly original ideas. Everything is a remix of what came before. The Beatles stole from blues musicians. Shakespeare stole from ancient myths. Picasso stole from African art. We're all just creative DJs mixing samples from the universe.

What makes something feel original is not that it's never been done before, but that it's never been done quite this way before. Focus on your unique perspective, your unique voice, your unique combination of influences. You're not creating from scratch; you're creating from your own unique blend of everything you've ever experienced.

## The Creative Life is a Marathon

Creativity is not a sprint—it's a marathon. You have to pace yourself, take care of your mental and physical health, and be patient with the process. It's like training for a marathon, but instead of running, you're creating things, and instead of a finish line, you're just trying to get better.

Some days you'll create nothing worth keeping. Some days you'll create something that surprises you. Most days will be somewhere in between. The key is to keep showing up, even when you don't feel like it. Consistency beats inspiration every time.

## The Joy of the Process

Despite all the challenges, there's nothing quite like the feeling of creating something that didn't exist before. Whether it's a piece of writing that makes someone think, a piece of code that solves a problem, or a piece of art that moves someone emotionally, there's magic in that moment. It's like being a tiny god, creating little universes out of nothing.

## Practical Tips for the Creative Life

1. **Show up every day**: Even if it's just for 15 minutes (consistency is key)
2. **Keep a notebook**: Capture ideas when they come (because they'll disappear faster than you can say "I'll remember that later")
3. **Embrace failure**: It's how you learn what doesn't work (and failure is way more educational than success)
4. **Find your rhythm**: Some people work best in the morning, others at night (I'm a night owl, but that's just me)
5. **Take breaks**: Creativity requires rest and reflection (your brain needs downtime to process)
6. **Share your work**: Get feedback, even when it's scary (vulnerability is where growth happens)
7. **Keep learning**: New skills and perspectives fuel creativity (the learning never stops)

## Conclusion

Creativity is messy, unpredictable, and often frustrating. But it's also one of the most rewarding things a person can do. It's how we make sense of the world, how we connect with others, and how we leave our mark on the universe.

The key is to stop waiting for inspiration and start creating. The inspiration will follow. And if it doesn't, you'll still have created something, which is better than nothing.
